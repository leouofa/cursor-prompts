## Refactoring

### Create a refactoring plan prompt
#### Prompt Step 1
- create a file called `notes.md`
- go through the files in the `directory` and update the `notes.md` with:
``` 
* with refactoring opportunities
* note filenames and line numbers
* describe the refactoring pattern that would be beneficial
* specifically look for things that can be turned into reusable service jobs and objects
```
- update the notes.md after each file
- look at related files if necessary for better understanding
- when you finish going through all the files iterate through notes.md and verify that the refactoring opportunities are there.

#### Prompt Step 2
Can you iterate through the notes.md and ensrue that all refactoring opportunties are there?
